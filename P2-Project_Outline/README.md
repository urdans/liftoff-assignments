## Submission Instructions


### Overview
Jose Urdaneta's project outline.

The project I’m proposing is a web site for small schools for the administration and control of evaluation plans and grading for students. Using this website, teachers will be able to grade the students in their subjects according to each subject’s evaluation plan; students will be able to see their grades; registrars will be able to make the students’ school enrollment and to add new hired teachers to the system.


### Features

User registration and login:
 - There will be 3 kinds of users: registrar, teacher and student.
 - Every user will be able to change their user id/password within their profile page. Changes to names can only be made by registrars.
 - OPTIONAL: website registration confirmation via email.

Data visualization:
 - Students will be able to see the grades for each subject he’s taken.
 - OPTIONAL: They’ll also be able to be shown some stats about the subjects he’s taken.

Data input:
 - Teachers will be able to grade the student that are taking their subjects.
 - OPTIONAL: They’ll also be able to be shown some stats about the students’ performances on their subjects.
